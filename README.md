# ExilePrecision

Very xd currently

***Seriously, do not attempt to use this unless you know what you're doing.  
This is a very early version and is not ready for use.***

Added some basic ass lightning strike routine to test

A lot of the foundation was directly taken from and/or inspired by [AutoMyAim](https://github.com/DetectiveSquirrel/AutoMyAim)

If you want something more functional I suggest using that for now for all your aiming needs.  
Combined with reagent you can achieve basic combat stuff.
